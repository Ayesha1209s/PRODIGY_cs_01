# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Tool

This Python program allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm — one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques in cryptography.

## 📌 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a **substitution cipher** where each letter in the plaintext is **shifted a certain number of places** down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

- A → D
- B → E
- C → F  
...and so on.

## 🛠️ Features

- Encrypt any text message using a user-defined shift value
- Decrypt messages back to original form using the same shift
- Handles both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters
- Leaves **spaces**, **numbers**, and **punctuation** unchanged
- User-friendly command-line interface

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone this repository or copy the script.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
